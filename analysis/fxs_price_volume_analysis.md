# FXS Token – Price, Market Cap & Volume Analysis (May–August 2025)

This section provides a data-driven analysis of the FXS token's market behavior based on price, market capitalization, and trading volume over the past 90 days. All data is collected using the public CoinGecko API.

---

## 1. Price Action

FXS experienced **two major price rallies** during this period:
- **Mid-May:** The token surged from ~$2.5 to nearly $4.
- **Mid-July:** A similar breakout pattern was observed, reaching again above $3.8.

Between these rallies, the price declined steadily to a low of ~$2.1 in late June, followed by a period of low volatility and sideways movement.

## 2. Market Capitalization

Market cap followed the same pattern as price, peaking at **$350M** during the May rally and again approaching similar levels in July. The correlation between price and market cap indicates that these were not isolated price moves caused by supply changes — but rather true market repricing based on demand.

## 3. Trading Volume

Volume analysis revealed:
- Spikes in volume exceeding **$90M/day** during both rallies.
- Low-volume consolidation zones between uptrends, especially in June and early July.

These patterns suggest increased trader interest during bull phases and market apathy during corrections.

## 4. Summary Observations

- **Strong price-volume correlation** suggests organic investor interest during rallies.
- **Market cap growth** aligned with price, confirming genuine market momentum.
- **Corrective phases** showed lower volume and slower movement, typical of healthy market structure.

FXS displayed cyclical behavior with price strongly reacting to macro trends or protocol-specific news (to be analyzed in later sections).
